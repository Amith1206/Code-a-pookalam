# Code-a-pookalam
Code-a-pookalam competition at Govt. Model Engineering College

FOSSMEC is taking inspiration from RIT event https://github.com/RITct/Code-A-Pookalam and invites entries
for pookalam designs made with code.

## Rules
Design can be made by python or any scripting language. You may also use web languages like CSS or JS too.
Keep all your work under a directory and place a pull request. Try to use only as minimum dependencies as possible. 
Be creative and think FREE AS IN FREEDOM.

Happy Onam! from FOSSMEC
